<h1 id="aboutH1">About Crypto Currency</h1>
    <p class="pAbout">A cryptocurrency is a digital, encrypted, and decentralized medium of exchange. Unlike the U.S.
        Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency.
        Instead, these tasks are broadly distributed among a cryptocurrency’s users via the internet.</p>

    <p class="pAbout"> You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services, although most people invest in cryptocurrencies as they
        would in other assets, like stocks or precious metals. While cryptocurrency is a novel and exciting asset class,
        purchasing it can be risky as you must take on a fair amount of research to understand how each system works
        fully.</p>

    <p class="pAbout"> Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, first outlined in principle by Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 paper titled
        “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto described the project as “an electronic payment
        system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”</p>

    <p class="pAbout">That cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded on a blockchain.</p>
